# Welcome to the world's most nice Media Scanner!

## What?
It's a small project that crawls a directory full of movies and separates out the 4K content. (well, specifically, content over 1080p)

## Why? 
I have a lot of media files in my personal library, and I'm learning about the best ways to encode, host, and serve these files. As time has gone by, I realized that when transcoding media, different settings should be used for 4K content than should be used for 1080p content. And it's difficult to run a batch job over all the files and dynamically change settings, so here we are, with the need to have 2 movie locations, 1 for 4K content and 1 for everything else

## Really? Is that it? 
Well, no. See I work at [Stately](https://stately.ai/) an awesome company centered around building deterministic flows. This was a great excuse to build one of those flows and dogfood our own product. So you're welcome.
